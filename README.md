# World_Weather_Analysis


## Background 

PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry. <br>

The head of analysis for the user interface team at the PlanMyTrip company has asked us to collect and present data for customers via the search page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. <br>

To perform this task we plan on taking the follwoing steps: 
- using a Jupyter notebook, and the CitiPy module to get the cities for more than 500 random latitudes and longitudes.
- Then perform requests on the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve the JSON weather data from these cities. 
- The weather data will be added to a Pandas DataFrame, where we will use Matplotlib to create a series of scatter plots to show the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world. 
- As part of our analysis, we will need to perform statistical calculations on the data using linear regression on the weather parameters in the northern and southern hemispheres. This data will help our team predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation. 
- Finally, we will export the data, clean it, and use the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on certain weather criteria and then map these cities using Jupyter G maps and the Google Places API. 



### Purpose

In this project we will use a Jupyter notebook, Pandas Library, the Python CitiPy module, Python Requests, APIs, and JSON Traversals to collect weather data from over 500 cities around the world. <br>
We will then analyze the data using pandas and plot the data using the matplotlib library and Google Maps API.  <br>
Finally, you will perform a statistical analysis with the SciPy Library. <br>
The end results will be a series of plots that visually and statistically show the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather parameters.
